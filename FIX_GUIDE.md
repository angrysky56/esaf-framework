# ESAF Framework - Complete Fix Guide

## 🔴 THE MAIN ISSUE
You've been running the **HTTP web version** (`npm run dev`) instead of the **Tauri desktop app** (`npm run tauri:dev`).

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Stop any running servers
Press `Ctrl+C` in any terminal running the dev server.

### Step 2: Start the Tauri Desktop App
```bash
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/esaf-framework
./start-esaf.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

## 🎯 What You'll See

1. **A Desktop Application Window** (not a browser tab) will open
2. **Full ESAF Framework UI** with:
   - ✅ Chat Interface with conversation continuity
   - ✅ Persistent chat history (left sidebar)
   - ✅ Document Library (for context management)
   - ✅ All agents working with real algorithms
   - ✅ Dark/Light theme toggle
   - ✅ Settings panel with LLM configuration

## 📋 Features That Are Already Implemented- actually not true yet lol sorry, AI.
You can find pre-built packages here though, they may work even.

esaf-framework/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/ESAF Framework_0.1.0_amd64.deb


### Chat Continuity ✅
- Every conversation is automatically saved
- Switch between sessions in the History tab
- Previous context is included in new messages
- Sessions persist across app restarts

### Document Library ✅
- Upload files (drag & drop or browse)
- Add URLs for web content
- Select documents to include as AI context
- Manage with tags and descriptions

### Agent System ✅
- All agents use REAL mathematical algorithms
- Data Analysis Agent: Bayesian inference, statistical analysis
- Optimization Agent: Linear programming, genetic algorithms
- Game Theory Agent: Nash equilibrium calculations
- All coordinated by the Orchestrator

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **DON'T use `npm run dev`** - This only starts the web server
2. **USE `npm run tauri:dev`** - This starts the full desktop app
3. **DON'T look in the browser** - Look for the desktop window

## 🔧 If You Still Have Issues

### Check Tauri is installed:
```bash
cargo --version  # Should show cargo version
tauri --version  # Should show tauri-cli version
```

### Rebuild if needed:
```bash
npm run tauri:build  # Creates installable app
```

### Check the logs:
The Tauri app console (F12 in the app window) will show any errors.

## 📝 Verification Checklist

- [ ] A desktop application window (not browser)
